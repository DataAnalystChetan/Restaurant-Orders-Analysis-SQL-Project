## Observations:


Italian dishes dominate both orders and spending.

Orders with two pizzas tend to have higher total spending.

Items with higher prices (e.g., pizzas) appear more in top spend orders.


## Recommendations:

**Promote Italian Cuisine:** These are the most popular items. Introduce combo deals with pizzas to boost sales further.

**Upsell on Beverages/Desserts:** Include complementary items in high-spend orders to increase the average order value.

**Improve Item Popularity Spread:** Focus on marketing or bundling less popular items like salads or desserts.
