## Problem Statement
You've just been hired as a Data Analyst for a restaurant that offers a diverse menu and serves generous portions. The restaurant debuted a new menu at the start of the year, and You have been asked to delve into the customer data to determine which menu items are performing well or poorly and to identify the preferences of our top customers


## Dataset



The dataset used for analysis can be found [here](https://mavenanalytics.io/data-playground?page=2&pageSize=10).


## Objective

1. Explore the menu_items table to get an idea of what's on the new menu.
2. Explore the order_details table to get an idea of the data that's been collected.
3. Use both tables to understand how customers are reacting to the new menu.

## Observations:


Italian dishes dominate both orders and spending.

Orders with two pizzas tend to have higher total spending.

Items with higher prices (e.g., pizzas) appear more in top spend orders.


## Recommendations:

**Promote Italian Cuisine:** These are the most popular items. Introduce combo deals with pizzas to boost sales further.

**Upsell on Beverages/Desserts:** Include complementary items in high-spend orders to increase the average order value.

**Improve Item Popularity Spread:** Focus on marketing or bundling less popular items like salads or desserts.
